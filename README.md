## RevNotebooks

This repository houses several of the [RevBayes tutorials](https://revbayes.github.io/tutorials/) that have been translated for
use with the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). The RevNotebook is a living document, combining text, images and executable code. In order to use the RevNotebook, you must first install a Rev kernel into your [Python environment](https://github.com/revbayes/revbayes_kernel).
